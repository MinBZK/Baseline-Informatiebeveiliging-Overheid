# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# users below will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.js    @js-owner # Remove '#' where necessary to activate it

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the octocats team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
# *.txt @octo-org/octocats # Remove '#' where necessary to activate it

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @doctocat # Remove '#' where necessary to activate it

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# docs/*  docs@example.com # Remove '#' where necessary to activate it

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
# apps/ @octocat # Remove '#' where necessary to activate it

# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory
# will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
# /scripts/ @doctocat @octocat # Remove '#' where necessary to activate it

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
# /apps/ @octocat # Remove both '#' where necessary to activate it
# /apps/github
